# Taxi-Booking-System


Welcome to the Taxi Booking System project repository! This project focuses on developing a software solution for managing user data and facilitating taxi booking services, inspired by popular ride-hailing apps like Uber, Careem, and Lyft.

## Overview

In this project, we implemented object-oriented programming concepts using C++ to create a user-friendly system for taxi registration and booking. Through the power of classes and functions, we established a functional structure that mimics the real-world process of signing up, logging in, and booking taxis.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can sign up by providing their essential information, ensuring a personalized experience.

- **Login Services**: The system enables secure user login, ensuring data privacy and access control.

- **Taxi Booking**: Users can conveniently book taxis, choosing between different classes and exploring taxi details.

- **Error Handling**: The system includes robust error handling mechanisms, guiding users through the process smoothly.

- **Text File Data Storage**: User data, taxi information, and pricing details are efficiently stored in text files.
